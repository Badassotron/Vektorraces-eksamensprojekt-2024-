# Programmering-Eksamensprojekt-2024
Our program is based on the game vector race. A game about drawing vectors on a race track and getting to the finish line first. We have developed an algorithm that can draw and read a race track and then find the fastest route around this track. For this project we have used libraries such as numpy and frameworks such as pygame. We use Numpy because the project requires mathematical calculations to calculate several vectors and Numpy is an extended calculator for Python. We use Pygame to make the graphic part of our project easier.
